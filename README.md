<h2>🛠️ Software and Tools Required</h2>

To set up and run this project locally, you will need the following tools installed and configured:

### 🔸 1. XAMPP
- Used for running **Apache** and **MySQL (phpMyAdmin)** services.
- Download: [https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
- Start **Apache** and **MySQL** from the XAMPP Control Panel.

### 🔸 2. Eclipse IDE (Enterprise Edition)
- Preferred IDE for developing Java EE (Enterprise Edition) web applications.
- Download: [Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/)
- Make sure to install plugins for JSP/Servlet support if not included by default.

### 🔸 3. Apache Tomcat 9
- Servlet container and web server used to deploy and run the application.
- Download: [https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi)
- Setup Steps:
  1. Open Eclipse → Go to `Servers` tab (bottom).
  2. Click `No servers are available. Click this link to create a new server`.
  3. Choose `Apache → Tomcat v9.0 Server`.
  4. Browse and select the folder where you extracted Tomcat 9.
  5. Finish setup and start the server from Eclipse.

### 🔸 4. Java JDK (Version 8 or later)
- Required for compiling and running Java code.
- Download: [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html)

### ⚙️ Project Setup Overview

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open it in Eclipse as a Dynamic Web Project.
3. Configure Tomcat Server in Eclipse.
4. Start XAMPP and import the SQL database (if provided) via phpMyAdmin.
5. Deploy the project on Tomcat and run.

<br>

## 🗃️ XAMPP Dummy Database Initialization

To run this project properly, you need to import the dummy database into **phpMyAdmin** using XAMPP.

### 🔽 Steps to Import Database

1. Start **XAMPP** and run the following services:
   - ✅ Apache
   - ✅ MySQL

2. Open your browser and go to:
    <a href="http://localhost/phpmyadmin">http://localhost/phpmyadmin</a>

3. Click on **"Import"** tab in the top menu.

4. Download and select the SQL file from the link below:

🔗 [Download SQL File](https://www.dulshan.epizy.com/sql/tour)

5. Click **"Go"** to import the database.

### 📝 Notes:
- This will create the required tables and dummy data for your tour booking system.
- Make sure the database name in your code (`web.xml`, `DBConnection.java`, etc.) matches the one in the SQL file (usually `tour`).
